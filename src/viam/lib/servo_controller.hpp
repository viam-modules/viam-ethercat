//
// ServoController owns the real-time loop for one servo. It is SDK-free (src/viam/lib), separate
// from the Viam module glue. It owns the EtherCAT Master,
// the CommandQueue, the RT thread, the resolved field offsets, the lifecycle FSM, and the
// published ControllerState atomics. The behaviors the library leaves to the driver live here:
//   (a) fault-reset rising-edge re-arm (Cia402Fsm::step returns the level),
//   (b) staleness -> fail-safe is_powered()/is_moving(),
//   (c) is-moving/reached: the generic base trusts statusword bit 10; a device subclass
//       overrides reached_target() for drives that tie bit 10 permanently high,
//   (d) the runtime mode-switch orchestration (run_mode_switch), and
//   (e) the std::variant lifecycle FSM.
//
// Concurrency contract (load-bearing):
//  * The RT thread is the only toucher of master_ and the queue's pop during operation.
//    reconfigure() joins the RT thread before master_.reset(), so the reset never races the loop.
//  * Every non-RT accessor and the go_to/go_for completion wait reads only ControllerState
//    atomics and stopping_, never master_, so a concurrent is_powered() or parked go_to cannot
//    dereference a pointer reconfigure() is resetting.
//  * commands_ is held by value and never reset until the dtor (after join), so a late non-RT
//    push() cannot hit a destroyed queue.
//  * api_mutex_ (shared for the API, exclusive for start/stop/reconfigure) serializes
//    lifecycle-vs-lifecycle and lifecycle-vs-push. go_to releases it before parking (its wait
//    uses only atomics), so a multi-second move does not block reconfigure.
